User Stories
Feature 1
● As a user, I would like to be able to filter events by city so that I can see the list of events that take place in that city.

Scenario 1: WHEN USER HASN’T SEARCHED FOR A CITY, SHOW UPCOMING EVENTS FROM ALL CITIES.

Given user hasn’t searched for any city

When the user opens the app

Then the user should see a list of all upcoming events

Scenario 2: USER SHOULD SEE A LIST OF SUGGESTIONS WHEN THEY SEARCH FOR A CITY.

Given the main page is open

When user starts typing in the city textbox

Then the user should see a list of cities (suggestions) that match what they’ve typed

Scenario 3: USER CAN SELECT A CITY FROM THE SUGGESTED LIST.

Given the user was typing “Berlin” in the city textbox And the list of suggested cities is showing

When the user selects a city (e.g., “Berlin, Germany”) from the list

Then their city should be changed to that city (i.e., “Berlin, Germany”) And the user should receive a list of upcoming events in that city

Feature 2
● As a user, I would like to be able to show/hide event details so that I can see more/less information about an event.

Scenario 1: An event element is collapsed by default

Given a list of events has opened When user scrolls through events Then all details should be hidden

Scenario 2: User can expand an event to see its details

Given list of events has opened When user clicks on a event Then the event details should be expanded

Scenario 3: User can collapse an event to hide its details

Given event details has expanded When user clicks hide button Then event details should be hidden

Feature 3
● As a user, I would like to be able to specify the number of events I want to view in the app so that I can see more or fewer events in the events list at once.

Scenario 1: When user hasn’t specified a number, 32 is the default number

Given the number of displayed events has not been specified by the user When event list is shown Then the default number of events displayed should be 32

Scenario 2: User can change the number of events they want to see

Given user has specified the number of displayed events to 4 When the event list is shown Then the number of events displayed should be 4

Feature 4
● As a user, I would like to be able to use the app when offline so that I can see the events I viewed the last time I was online.

Scenario 1: Show cached data when there’s no internet connection

Given the user has no internet connetion When the user opens the app Then the app should display cached data

Scenario 2: Show error when user changes the settings (city, time range)

Given the user has no internet connection When the user opens the app and changes the settings (city, time range) Then a error should be displayed

Feature 5
● As a user, I would like to be able to add the app shortcut to my home screen so that I can open the app faster.

Feature 6
● As a user, I would like to be able to see a chart showing the upcoming events in each city so that I know what events are organized in which city.

Scenario 1: Show a chart with the number of upcoming events in each city

Given the user has not chosen a city When the app is open Then a chart with the number of upcoming events in each city should be shown
